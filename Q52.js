// An element is a majority if it appears more than half of the time in the array excluding the current index.

// So in [2, null, null, 2, null]:

// 2 is majority at index 0 and 3.

// No element meets the majority condition at other indices.

// An element appears more than half of the remaining elements.

// So, for a majority to exist:

// maxCount > (arr.length - 1) / 2

// But since we don't want to use division, we multiply both sides by 2:

// maxCount * 2 > arr.length - 1

// âœ… This is what the code uses:

// if (maxCount * 2 > arr.length - 1)  if division is allowed-if (maxCount > (arr.length - 1) / 2)
